        </section>
        <p> Dear Eileen,<br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University
of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3 class="color red">Starting dates</h3>
        <P>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with 
    us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
     could start at the beginning of a semester; the start
      dates for each one are as follows:</P>
      <ul>
          <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>

        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility dedicated researcher:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores</li>
        </ol>
         <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these Subjects.
         Thanks.
         </p>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. 
        To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance 
                around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*. </dd>
            
        </dl>
        <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a>
